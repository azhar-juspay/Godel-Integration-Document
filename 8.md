# Tracking back button press

We also provide unblocking helps when the user presses the back button. This is intelligently controlled by assessing the current state of the transaction. You can call ***juspayBackPressedHandler*** in the onBackPressed method of your Activity. If you don't want Juspay to control the backbutton you can pass false as the argument in juspayBackPressedHandler, else pass true.

@Override
public void onBackPressed() {
    browserFragment.juspayBackPressedHandler(shouldShowJuspayCloseDialog);
    // Your code to show a dialog box if you are passing false.
}

If Juspay is unable to provide help and the user closes the transaction session using the "Cancel Transaction" dialog box, we provide a callback to the activity, ***JuspayBackButtonCallback#transactionCancelled***. Please note, this callback is not called if the user clicks any Abort/Cancel button in the webpage, this action is handled by the webpage itself.

```
JuspayBackButtonCallback backButtonCallback = new JuspayBackButtonCallback() {

        @Override
        public void transactionCancelled() {
            finish();
        }
    };

browserFragment.setupJuspayBackButtonCallbackInterface(backButtonCallback);
```
