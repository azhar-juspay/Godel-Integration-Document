# How Godel Works


In the normal flow, you would simply include the WebView in the view XML of your activity/fragment and load the URL (or postURL). Godel encapsulates the WebView into a fragment and all our enhancements are driven through this.

To integrate with Godel, you will replace the existing WebView with our Fragment. You could directly include the Fragment as is or use a FrameLayout to inject it later.
