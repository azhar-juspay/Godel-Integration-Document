## Android Permissions

The following are the minimum set of permissions required for the library to work as expected:

```
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_SMS" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECEIVE_SMS" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" />
```

#### Additional permissions preferred:

```
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.SEND_SMS"/>
```


In order to support sending SMS for handling CITI Bank, we will need SEND_SMS permission. However, this permission is optional. When this permission is not available, CITI Bank card transactions will not be enhanced by the library.
