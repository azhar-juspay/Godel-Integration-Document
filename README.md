# Introduction

#### Welcome to Godel Integration Docmentation!

Juspay Safe Browser (Code Name: Godel) is a 3D secure assistance library created with the intention to help out customers with second factor authentication. Most banks implement off the shelf solutions for 3D secure and in most cases they turn out to be extremely cumbersome for customers to use. With Godel, merchants will be able to provide a pleasing experience on top of the existing 3D secure infrastructure.

The Solution

Godel, an Android library, can be included by the merchants as part of their Android build. Godel will come into picture only at the time of 3D secure flow. The webview will be augmented with an assistance frame which will directly interact with the page.
