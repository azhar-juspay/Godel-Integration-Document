### Strategy #3: Start BrowserFragment using Order and Card information

This is applicable when you are using **Juspay's Payment Gateway** in the backend. Assuming you have collected the card information from the user, you can launch the fragment as follows:

```
Card card = new Card(cardNumber, cardExpiryMonth, cardExpiryYear);
card.setCVV(cvv);
Bundle args = new Bundle();
args.putString("merchantId", juspayMerchantId);
args.putString("orderId", orderId));
args.putString("card", card);
browserFragment.setArguments(args);
```

If you are using **Juspay to store your cards** you can launch the browser using a stored card token as follows:

```
StoredCard card = new StoredCard(cardToken, cardNumberMask, expiryMonth, expiryYear);
card.setCVV(cvv);
Bundle args = new Bundle();
args.putString("merchantId", juspayMerchantId);
args.putString("orderId", orderId));
args.putString("card", card);
browserFragment.setArguments(args);
```

This will first fetch the ACS url from juspay servers and then load the 3D secure page directly. This is assuming that the PG backend supports this. In other cases, we will follow the redirection mode.  If you would like to do the part on loading the acs url yourself or would like to direct the user to a third party url (Like PayU, Citrus etc) which will inturn direct them to the acs page see Strategy#1 and Strategy#2.
