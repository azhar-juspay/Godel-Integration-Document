# Track payment status

As soon as the payment is over, send us the notification on the status of the payment. These responses are crucial in order to track transaction success/failure metrics. For instance:

```
GodelTracker.getInstance().trackPaymentStatus(:transactionId,
        GodelTracker.PaymentStatus.SUCCESS);
```


Payment status can be one of: ***SUCCESS***, ***FAILURE*** or ***CANCELLED***.
