# Merchant Checklist

Please ensure that the following steps are accomplished to have a cleaner integration.
1. The AndroidManifest.xml entry for the activity should say android:windowSoftInputMode="adjustResize".
2. The activity holding the Juspay Fragment should fix the orientation as portrait.
3. Ensure that correct value is sent for merchantId, transactionId and clientId
4. At the end of the flow, payment status is being tracked using the call GodelTracker.trackPaymentStatus
5. All the classes under in.juspay.godel namespace should be kept out of ProGuard optimization.
